Logging and Debugging
Always start reading errors from last line as that is where the issue usually is.

stack trace- the terminal result where we read errors.

There are multiple levels of logging.
Priority levels are top down.

Check step over, step into and watch expression.

exrecise: fix error, add logging and do debugging on debug file
